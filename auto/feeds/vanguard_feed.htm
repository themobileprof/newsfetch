			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This, before some one starts to say ‘not again’, is not about me. Its about my egbon. Mr Mac Ovbiagele, a foremost advertising practitioner, and I dare say, one of the best in his generation—likes to do things by the book. I should know since I have known him for almost 40 years and I have used him as a sounding board for many of my projects.</p>
<p>True to type, when he realised he needed to travel to Canada, he started preparing early. By January, he  had booked his ticket for a wedding that was to take place towards the end of July.</p>
<p>On May 4, he took his passport with all the necessary documents to the Canadian Embassy. Although the Embassy said the applicants should give an allowance of 30 working days for processing, he was prepared to give more.</p>
<p>When he got to the Embassy, he met three ladies he had known for a long time. One of them was his contemporary at the University of Ibadan. Everybody was confident that they had made early preparations and acted responsibly. But had they?</p>
<p>Three weeks later, one of them had an all expenses paid offer for a three-day trip to Dubai for a board meeting. But she didn’t go because her passport was in the Canadian Embassy vaults. Another of the ladies thought it would be a good opportunity to cross over to the US after her business in Canada. She wasn’t sure if her visa would not have expired at that time and she wanted to book for an appointment at the US Embassy. But she could not because her passport was locked up in the vaults of the Canadian Embassy.</p>
<p>The third lady had what turned out to be a fortuitous experience. Her son had a bad back condition that needed to be operated on. The doctors advised a quick operation so that some nerves would not be damaged permanently. Again, her passport was locked up in the Canadian vault. But being an ‘abiyamo’ (an endearing Yoruba word for motherhood) she decided that her son’s life was more important than going to Canada. When she made moves to retrieve her passport, she was told, ominously, that she would have to go to the bottom of the line and start all over again if she brought her passport back. She retrieved her passport any way and flew to the UK with her son. The operation was timely and was successful. What’s more, she put in for the Canadian visa in the UK. To her surprise, her application was granted in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Please note. It was the same woman, the same passport and the same documents. You want to ask. What is it about Nigeria that sets these Western countries on edge? And why should any country lock up any body’s passport for any length of time in this day and age? Back to my big brother, Mr Ovbiagele. Sensing that he might not be able to make his earlier booking, he</p>
<p>[ wanted a new date. He was asked by his travel agency to cough up an extra two hundred thousand naira for something that was definitely not his fault. So he did what any reasonable man would in the circumstances. He took the ‘aso -ebi’ and all the wedding things in his possession and couriered them to Canada — at a considerable cost of course—and cancelled his booking. As we speak, more than three months after, none of these three people has had their visa or their passport returned to them. P.S. Now, I have just been told that a friend’s wife (and also my wife’s friend) has just been refused a UK</p>
<p>Visa. Reason? She didn’t show ‘sufficient attachment’ either to the US where she resides, or to Nigeria,</p>
<p>her country of birth.</p>
<p>Now, this lady is close to 60. She is a grandmother who has been travelling to the UK for at least 30 years.</p>
<p>She has a green card which entitles her to live and work in the US. She and her husband have a beautiful home in the US, and beautiful homes in Nigeria. All her children had their tertiary education in the US. A couple are back in Nigeria and the others comfortably settled in the US. No child lives in the UK. And they say she doesn’t have ‘sufficient attachment’ to Nigeria or the’ US</p>
<p>All she wanted was to be able to attend the wedding of her niece slated for early August. And as at the time she applied, she had a five-year visa which was about to expire. Now tell me. What pull does UK have over the US and Nigeria where she has her family, her home, and her businesses? And if it was her intention to disappear into the thin (or wet) UK air, why did she have to wait for her five year visa to expire? Doesn’t make much sense does it?</p>
<p>PS 2 I am sure there are many ridiculous and sometimes ludicrous visa experiences out there. I’d like to hear (and maybe air) them.</p>
<p>I told you of mine six months ago at the US Embassy. To their credit, they responded and corrected what many considered to be an anomaly.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Nigerian police said Friday they had arrested a governor's aide over a church massacre and an attack on a military patrol that killed 23 people, but his involvement was not clear.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LAGOS  (AFP) &#8211; The Nigerian police said Friday they had arrested a governor&#8217;s aide over a church massacre and an attack on a military patrol that killed 23 people, but his involvement was not clear.</p>
<p>The Gov. Idris Wada of Kogi has called on Muslims in the country to imbibe the teaching of Ramadan and use the opportunity of the Eid-El-Fitr to pray for national peace, progress and security.</p>
<p>The attacks this month were similar to scores blamed on Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has targeted Christians as well as the security forces in a series of gun raids and suicide blasts.</p>
<p>Kogi state police chief Muhammed Katsina said that special adviser to the state governor Yahaya Karaku and four others &#8220;are being detained and interrogated over their suspected involvement in the attacks on the Deeper Life Church and military patrol team&#8221;.</p>
<p>Gunmen stormed the evangelical church on August 6 in Okene in Kogi state, cut the electricity and opened fire on worshippers, killing 19 people including the pastor.</p>
<p>The following day, assailants shot at troops patrolling outside a government building in the city, sparking an exchange of gunfire that left two soldiers and two of the gunmen dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to determine the involvement of these five suspects in these attacks as well as arms and ammunition recovered in Okene and its environs,&#8221; Katsina told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to trace the sources of these arms and those behind the attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kogi state government spokesman Jacob Edi confirmed the arrests of Karaku and Abubakar Adagu, a former local government council chairman, vowing that officials would not protect them if they are found culpable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law must take it course,&#8221; Edi told AFP.</p>
<p>It was not clear who carried out the church killings or whether the two attacks were linked, although a police spokesman has said there was &#8220;suspicion&#8221; that the same group was responsible for both assaults.</p>
<p>The police also previously said they had raided a suspected hideout of militants who carried out attacks in the state, arresting a key leader and two other suspects.</p>
<p>The Islamist sect Boko Haram, which has said it wants to create an Islamic state in the north, is believed to include a number of factions, including those with local political links.</p>
<p>The group has killed more than 1,400 people since 2010 in attacks across northern and central Nigeria, according to Human Rights Watch</p>
<p><em>Eid-el&#8211;Fitr: Gov Wada urges Muslims to pray for peace</em><br />
Gov. Idris Wada of Kogi has called on Muslims in the country to imbibe the teaching of Ramadan and use the opportunity of the Eid-El-Fitr to pray for national peace, progress and security.</p>
<p>Wada made the call in an Eid-el-Fitr message, issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Strategy, Mr Jacob Edi, in Lokoja on Friday.</p>
<p>The governor, who also congratulated Muslims on the successful completion of the Ramadan fast, called for mutual trust among the adherents of different faiths.</p>
<p>He said that peaceful co-existence and positive development could only be achieved in an atmosphere of religious tolerance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will achieve nothing in an atmosphere of insecurity, mutual distrust, crisis and violence. I enjoin all of us irrespective of religious belief to pray to God for peace and progress of our state.</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be no meaningful development without peace, our state is known for peace and anything that will affect or change this reality should not be encouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must rise against any form of evil in our state,&#8221; the governor said.</p>
<p>He urged the people to celebrate the Eid–el-Fitr peacefully and be law abiding.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Emma Amaize, Warri<br />
LAWYERS in Delta State have called off their boycott of courts in the state because of the kidnap of a judge of the state High Court, Justice Marcel Okoh, last Tuesday.</p>
<p>The boycott was suspended on Thursday soon after the news of the release of Justice Okoh, who spent about eight days in the custody of his kidnappers, came to the notice of the state leadership of the Nigeria Bar Association, NBA.</p>
<p>NBA chair in Warri, Chief Gweke Akudihor, confirmed to Saturday Vanguard in Warri, Friday, “We called off our action after confirming on Wednesday evening that the judge has been released”. <strong><em>Saturday Vanguard</em></strong> learnt that the state governor, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan , propelled the police and other security agencies to smoke out the kidnappers and ensure that the judge was released.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gov. Abdulfatah Ahmed of Kwara has dispelled rumours of a feud between him and Sen. Bukola Saraki, the immediate past governor of the state, describing it as &#8220;mischievous and reckless.’’</p>
<p>Ahmed said in a statement issued in Ilorin on Friday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Communications, Dr Muideen Akorede, that their relationship was cordial.</p>
<p>He described the rumour as a &#8220;lie propagated by the opposition parties in order to cause disaffection between them ahead of the 2015 elections in the state.’’</p>
<p>&#8220;Ours is a unique partnership based on mutual respect, which grows stronger daily due to our long history and standing commitment to making Kwara a model for other states in terms of economic growth and prosperity for the people.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are like a tag-team in which we are pulling our strengths together in a determined effort to build a greater Kwara for the benefit of posterity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sen. Saraki is a man for whom I retain the highest regard and I am happy to state that the feeling is reciprocal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our relationship, rather than wane, remains cordial and strong; the speculation is a figment of the opposition&#8217;s imagination,” the governor said.</p>
<p>He said his administration was a continuation of the immediate-past government, which made the state to record laudable successes by scaling up laudable programmes initiated by his predecessor.</p>
<p>The governor assured that his administration would remain focused on how to move the state forward, noting that 2015 was still ‘far off.’ (NAN)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By NDAHI MARAMAMaiduguri<br />
Gunmen had on Thursday evening shot and killed Alhaji Zannah Kafilama, the former Secretary to the Late Shehu of Borno, Alhaji (Dr.) Mustapha Umar Elkanemi after performing his 8pm (Tarawih prayers) at a Mosque in Polo Area of Maiduguri metropolis.</p>
<p>An eye witness who does not want his name mentioned  told our Correspondent that two gunmen came into the mosque before other congregations around 8pm and pretend as if they are waiting for the normal time for the Tarawih prayer., Unfortunately, one of the gunmen hid his AK47 rifles, under his Sallaya carpet, pointing out that as soon as they were about going out of the mosque after the prayers they heard a sound of gunshots, a situation that forced those who were inside and around the Mosque to run away for their dear lives.</p>
<p>Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer DSP Gabriel Jibrin said, some gunmen had on thursday trailed Alhaji Zannah to a Mosque in Polo Area, and after performing the Prayers altogether, the gunmen shot him dead and fled without being arrest.”</p>
<p>Jibrin said, already investigation has commenced with a view to arrest the culprits even as he added that the Joint Task Force has condoned off the area to prevent further attack and killings.</p>
<p>He stated that the security agencies are doing everything possible to ensure a hitch-free Ed-il Fitr celebration in and around the troubled state, adding that people should continue to cooperate with the JTF and the Police with information that will expose the hideouts of criminals in the state.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Vincent Ujumadu<br />
Since the struggle for the actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra began, one personality that had been synonymous with it was Chief Ralph Uwazurike, leader of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB.</p>
<p>However, another group known as the Biafra Zionist Movement, BZM, led by Mr. Ben Onwuka appears to have taken the front seat in the struggle with his recent application to the United Nations, UN, and the African Union, AU, for the recognition the Republic.</p>
<p>In the application dated August 6, 2012, reference: BZM/OS/Rep of Biafra and addressed to the UN Security Council through the Secretary General, Dr. Ban Ki Moon, Onwuka sounded very optimistic that what he had done would lead to the actualization of his dream Republic. The application read:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanguardngr.com/?attachment_id=304687" rel="attachment wp-att-304687"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-304687" title="biafra" src="http://vml1.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/biafra.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="" width="412" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>“We the people of the Republic of Biafra do hereby humbly submit our Application for Membership of the United Nations as an observer member. Our application is based on the following two grounds / factors namely:</p>
<p>“It is now abundantly clear that the security of life and property of the Biafran people are no longer guaranteed in the entity called Nigeria.</p>
<p>Therefore,  the People of Biafra have resolved that on 5th November 2012, we shall be re-declaring our independence  and opt  out  of Nigeria in order that we the Biafran people can protect and guarantee the life and property of our citizens as required by International Law.</p>
<p>“It is now also very clear that the right of the Biafran people to peacefully practice their religion and freedom of association under the United Nations Charter of Freedom of Association, is no longer safe and guaranteed in the entity called Nigeria.  Therefore the people of Biafra have resolved to opt out of Nigeria on 5th November 2012, in order to guarantee and protect the Biafran people’s right to practice their religion without being killed or bombed.</p>
<p>“Your Excellencies, it is on the above grounds/ factors that the Biafran people seek to regain their freedom and Independence from Nigeria on 5th November 2012.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the Biafran people, we thank you in advance for the consideration of our application and we look forward to hearing from you.”</p>
<p>Onwuka told Saturday Vanguard that with the application, the Biafra Republic would receive the recognition it had lacked since the Republic was declared in May, 1967. According to him, the UN would henceforth have the mandate and power to intervene, investigate and issue arrest warrant against anyone who uses violence or force to kill Biafrans in their quest for self determination as guaranteed under the UN.</p>
<p>He further claimed that with the development, it is against international law for Nigerian state through the president, governors, security operatives to use force to kill any Biafran either as an individual or as a group as the offender could face the UN tribunal on war crimes based at the Hague, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>He said further that UN would send observers to the Biafra re-declaration of independence on November 5, 2012, just as another application had been made for Biafra to be accorded the same observer status at the African Union, AU, through its secretariat at Addis Ababa.</p>
<p>Asked if he was doing it in collaboration with MASSOB which had been in the forefront for the struggle since the end of the Nigerian civil war, Onwuka answered in the negative, arguing that the Republic would never be realized if the approach adopted by MASSOB is to be followed.</p>
<p>According to him, the issue is not something to be achieved through sensationalism, adding that the best approach would be to be in constant contact with the international body and convince them to see the need for the emergence of Biafra. He said: “We are making contact with our allies namely, USA, Israel, Canada and EU countries and their favourable disposition towards our cause is what gives us encouragement.</p>
<p>As it stands, Onwuka appears to be capitalizing on the fact that the MASSOB leader, Uwazurike, appears to have soft pedaled as some people feel that he is presently more comfortable with the idea of being named the successor to the late Ezeigbo Gburugburu, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu.</p>
<p>In fact, Saturday Vanguard gathered that Onwuka decided to come to the forefront in the struggle following reports that Uwazurike appears to have become comfortable with playing Nigerian politics. For instance, his stand that Biafrans would not oppose President Goodluck Jonathan in any way because he is from the Southern part of Nigeria was seen as relegating the issue of Biafra to the background.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Johnbosco Agbakwuru, Calabar<br />
<em>H</em><em>ome my home o my home, when shall I see my home, when shall I see my native land, I will never forget my home</em>! This is the song going on now as we see Abana two pools away. We shall soon send video clips of our activities for all to see.</p>
<p>A lot had taken place quietly within last week and now. With the end of Ramadan on Sunday, most things will be clearer.</p>
<p>“Bakassi, land of our birth, we pledge to you, that neither silver nor gold shall dissuade us from taking you back. We did not choose the land of our birth neither did we choose our parents, Almighty placed us there, and we were uprooted in broad-day light, and hurrily so, by a President who was supposed to protect us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanguardngr.com/?attachment_id=304688" rel="attachment wp-att-304688"><img class="size-full wp-image-304688 alignleft" title="bakassi" src="http://vml1.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bakassi.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a></p>
<p>May God prolong his life and protect his children ! Land of our birth, we love thee, Nigeria refused to protect thee; we are already there and ‘they’ know it not, waiting for time which will soon come.” These were the words of one Ekpe Ekpenyong Oku, who claims to be the warlord and Commandant General, Bakassi Self Determination Front on the agitation for a liberated displaced Bakassi people.</p>
<p>The atmosphere around the ceded oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula has been tensed while residents of Day Spring which is supposedly the rightful resettlement area have been leaving the place and it is now being guarded by some militant groups championing the declaration of independent Bakassi.</p>
<p>Already the militant group who spoke through their Commandant General, Ekpenyong Oku, had declared last Saturday, August 11, 2012 as Gen. Sani Abacha day where all Bakassi people and men and women of goodwill offered prayers in the afternoon for the repose of his soul and the souls of officers and men who lost their lives for the sake of Bakassi.</p>
<p>The self acclaimed ‘freedom fighters’ had directed their members to wear black bands while the Bakassi paramount ruler, His Majesty Etim Okon Edet was directed to appear in white wrapper and shirt and offer specific prayers to his forebears at 6am, 12noon and 6 pm.</p>
<p>The Commandant in a statement issued last week declared that Dayspring Radio station last week started test-run transmission on 4.2MHz and 5.2MHz shortwave band, hoisted its ‘national flag’ and further stated that “major declaration shall be made as we push forward. May God bless our people and renew their strength.”</p>
<p>He also said, “As the D-Day draws near, we call on all men of goodwill, individuals, human rights organizations and the indigenous people of Bakassi to join hands in resisting and fighting the present international conspiracy.</p>
<p>In a maiden broadcast, the Commander-General, Ekpe Ekpenyong Oku, said, “Please for the umpteenth time, we plead with our people to leave Abana now. The fight is going to be thickest and fiercest now that our brothers from Northern Nigeria have fully arrived. Our Eastern brothers are also here. If blood would be required to set the people free, take mine. As you confronted pharaoh, do so now.”</p>
<p>He warned all travelers on the sea to stay away from the area last Saturday, Auguast 11 and Sunday, August 12, 2012, it is not good to travel on the sea.</p>
<p>He said, “No sea movement so that you don’t have cause to regret. There shall be no movement of boats from Ikang or Marina beach to Cameroon on these two days. Be warned.” In a statement made available to newsmen in Calabar, Oku, had revealed that arrangements have been concluded with some international liberation groups to assist the Bakassi natives in the battle ahead.</p>
<p>He said, “Ours will be a classical story of the elephant and the ant. The elephant will be so harassed and will find no respite and will dash itself against a tree trunk, adding, “Throughout history, injured people have had to resort to arms in their self-defense where peaceful negotiations fail.</p>
<p>“Bakassi people are no exception. Our right to self-determination is imminent; some will die, but some will leave to reap from our labours,” the Commander-general stated.</p>
<p>It would be recalled that on July 9, 2006 in the wake of the Green Tree Agreement, a group under the aegis of Bakasssi Freedom Fighters had threatened to seek independence if Nigeria renounced sovereignty, but a few days to handing over of Bakassi to Cameroon in the government house in Calabar, Cross River State, the leader of the militant group, Comrade Tony Ene, died in a mysterious road accident along Calabar-Itu highway.</p>
<p>Ene and his group of Bakasssi Freedom Fighters had even hoisted the Bakassi flag with the rising sun as its symbol in Abana, headquarters of Bakasssi but this was repelled by the Nigerian government.</p>
<p>Already the BSDF had claimed that it has penetrated parts of the ceded Bakassi peninsula in their bid to get the land back. A post from the group’s Facebook wall by the Commandant General claimed they were already at Akpa Ukwak quite close to Akpankanya in the area.</p>
<p>Apart from the claim by the militant group that they have advanced towards some vital area of the ceded island, there have been no much military presence from the federal government within the disputed area. It was only few plain cloths security operatives that move around the area to monitor the unfolding events.</p>
<p>In an interview in Calabar, the Paramount Ruler of Bakassi His Majesty Etim Okon-Edet said “From what I have heard, the boys have entered Ekoi and have entered Akwa Ukwak and they have nearly entered Akpankaya which is near Abana.</p>
<p>“They have entered and no life is lost. It means that the gods are with them and I pray that the gods of the land should continue to be with them until the whole area is reclaimed quietly and silently,” he said.</p>
<p>The Bakassi Paramount Ruler had told the House of Representatives Committee on Treaty and Agreement that visited Bakassi stakeholders at the Council of Chiefs Chambers Calabar that , “Bakassi people have not been fairly treated by this nation and what we are looking for now that you have come is to go back to our area by any means possible .</p>
<p>“We don’t even want relocation any longer, we are going to take it by whatever means because we have been left astray for almost ten years now. Come to add to it they have taken our land, taken our resources so we now know that we are not wanted. I have just seen some people doing bomb, they have not seen bomb yet, what they are doing is a very small bomb.</p>
<p>“The process is one and we are going back to our area, we will take it by any means possible, in the days of old our fore-fathers use to have traditional means, we don’t have any problem with Nigeria our problem is with the cameroun that they must leave our area and they are going to leave very soon. Nigeria can go and leave us .there was Bakassi before political Nigeria and there was Bakassi before political Cameroun.</p>
<p>“People have been dreaming and planning on how to break Nigeria and people have been predicting that in 2015 Nigeria will break up and they have been looking for avenues to achieve this and Nigeria is opening its flanks to those things and so many things are happening unabated.</p>
<p>“Bakassi will be one of them and when anything happens there God almighty will exonerate us. When anything happens Nigeria will bear us witness that we have waited for long. We don’t have any problem with ICJ and I don’t want anybody to go and appeal any case because it will be waste of time and money we want to take our area out and we will do so and Nigerians will see with their two eyes that God is still on the throne.”</p>
<p>The prediction that the country may disintegrate in 2015 may come to fruition if the signals coming is not well handled from the federal government. However, it is still doubtful if the Bakassi Self determination Front will make use of their treat because apart from issuing press statements especially on the facebook, there is no serious sign that they mean business unlike some other groups like the MASSOB and MOSOP who seem to be visible.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Kate Henshaw<br />
Since the closure of the 3rd Mainland Bridge for repair works, it has been hellish going back and forth the Mainland. I try to avoid unnecessary trips to the other side or reduce them to the barest minimum.</p>
<p>I weigh the importance of what I have to do over the bridge on a scale of preference as it always turns out to be a whole day’s trip. Some things however need to be done to stay on the right side of the law as I am a huge advocate of that. I can then have the moral justification to complain to my heart’s content should services go awry.</p>
<p>Last year,  I was one of the many individuals inducted as a Celebrity Special Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps. The ceremony was held in the capital territory of Abuja and the Director, Corps Marshal Osita Chidoka performed this act and welcomed us into the organisation. We were given our reflective vest, cap and arm band and then saluted as we filed back to our seats.</p>
<p>The idea behind this innovation is to form a synergy between role models and their admirers to drive home the information the unit needs to disseminate to the public with regards to road safety in general.</p>
<p>The need for advocacy is quite strong. Be it in the schools, motor parks, hospitals, town hall meetings, etc. A meeting was scheduled for Wednesday, this week and I also had an appointment at the FRSC to capture my image for the renewal of my driver’s license (yes,I was still on that journey if you read my article few weeks ago). This was great as I could then kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>I set out at a reasonable time for obvious reasons, namely to arrive on time but then one can never predict what lies ahead on our roads. It all seemed smooth till I got to Eko Bridge to connect to Western Avenue, from there we crawled at snail speed all the way to Fadeyi Bus stop and then it eased out a bit. I had decided to take the Ojodu-Berger Express so as to be on the right side of the road when I got closer to my destination.</p>
<p>As I descended the Berger junction of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, eight men jumped out and one had a wooden plank with nails attached, ostensibly to tear my tyres should I try to drive off.</p>
<p>No such thought even crossed my mind. With confidence, I reached into my glove compartment and produced a sheaf of licenses, papers and permits (I was in my ONGA branded jeep). One of the men had a crest fallen look on his face but then it brightened up almost immediately “Ah madam, get one paper wey nor dey here”.</p>
<p>I was shocked for a brief second and with anger asked which permit was absent,”na consolidated media permit, you go follow us to our office”. I let one of them in who then proceeded to tell me that he watched my films and even had one of my songs on his phone. I was not interested in chit chat so I ignored him while I took directions on where their office was located.</p>
<p>On getting closer to the area where this local government, Ifo, I think it was called, the streets were littered with men carrying planks filled with nails, few wore vests but apart from their presence there was really no way of telling who they worked for.</p>
<p>I got to the office and it looked nothing like a local government office. Few men and women were gathered underneath a tree doing nothing but chatting and eating. Their faces lit up at the prospect of naira in their hands because I knew that would be the end result.</p>
<p>I was showed the supposed permit and told it was a( 7 in 1 permit: 1)Board of Internal revenue loading and offloading permit 2)Bureau of transport road users tax 3)Ministry of commerce permit 4)Route permit/interstate/road tax warrant permit 5)Vehicle commodity emblem permit 6)heavy/light duty 7)Agric levy.</p>
<p>Fifteen thousand Naira less in my pocket later, consolidated emblem permit in hand for Ogun State, I drove out of there to my meeting at the FRSC. On second thoughts, I should have “kidnapped” the man who got in my car. How do I know the money will be accounted for?</p>
<p>What is the use of so many permits then if the one I had just obtained was a consolidated one? Do they even know the meaning of the word, consolidated? Here comes the clincher, since I did not obtain it at the beginning of the year, it would expire in December!</p>
<p>The mind boggles at the amount of ineptitude and thievery in our local government areas. We complain to the Governor for so many things (I, inclusive) but what really is the function of the local government chairmen and who are they accountable to? My view is simply that of touts working for a kingpin who is faceless till election time, who then gets allocation for doing bugger all!</p>
<p>It is all well and good to pass laws but shouldn’t law makers be transparent in their dealings? A friend questioned why I let one of those men into my car, my reply was “I needed to see where all these led”. Beware, members of the public driving round in branded vehicles, we are moving targets to be regularly fleeced by these touts. The good news however is that, I left the FRSC with my temporary driver’s license.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Samuel Oyadongha, Yenagoa</p>
<p>For the Ijaws, the fourth largest ethnic nationality in the Nigerian federation, Wednesday signing into law of the Bayelsa symbols and seal by Governor Seriake Dickson was a welcome development.</p>
<p>Though the decision which was taken last Monday at the 7th meeting of the Bayelsa State Executive Council has sparked fresh controversies especially with the growing voices of secession across the country and escalating violence in the North, however the majority of the people of the state did not see anything wrong with the action of Governor Seriake Dickson, who incidentally is a lawyer and former member of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when most analysts had thought the state government would jettison the plan given the stormy debate it generated in some of quarters that it was a secessionist ploy, Hon. Seriake Dickson Wednesday went ahead to create a new identity, coat of arms and anthem for the state by signing the bill into Law.</p>
<div id="attachment_220385" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 422px"><a href="http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/11/bayelsa-guber-jonathans-candidate-clinches-pdp-ticket/seriake-dickson1/" rel="attachment wp-att-220385"><img class="size-full wp-image-220385" title="Seriake Dickson" src="http://vml1.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Seriake-Dickson1.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="" width="412" height="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"> Governor Seriake Dickson</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill known as the Bayelsa State Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem Law 2012 which was among the eight bills passed by the State House of Assembly has not only awaken old passion but ignited fresh hopes for the Ijaw nation the fourth largest ethnic nationality.</p>
<p>Bayelsa State to the Ijaw nation whose people are scattered as minorities in Ondo, Edo, Akwa Ibom and Delta states is regarded as their ‘Jerusalem,’ hence the new state flag with four colours (white, blue, red and green) and three stars represent the hope and aspirations of the people.</p>
<p>A source told Saturday Vanguard, “the white colour represents purity, honour and trustfulness  of the people and their quest for justice while the blue represents the abundance of waters and their inherent resources; the red colour symbolizes blood of our martyrs while the green colour signifies the rich vegetation and the stars, the hopes and aspirations of the Ijaw nation.</p>
<p>The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Daniel Iworiso-Markson, in a statement issued after the signing of the bill into Law said the new law will provide a unique opportunity for government to make a clear pronouncement on the real intendment of the law as follows:</p>
<p>“That Bayelsa State is a federating unit in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, created and recognized in the constitution with rights, powers and obligations. That all structures, organs and officials of the state operate under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. That our decision to have state symbols and songs, are as a result of our belief in true federalism as a cardinal cornerstone of Nigerian nationhood and it is in exercise of our inalienable rights as a federating unit.</p>
<p>“This is a right, which we cannot be denied of since several other states with the same rights have equally exercised. That the decision taken by our government in this regard is also as a result of our commitment to the propagation of Ijaw culture, language, history and ideals. That this decision also creates a platform for us as a government to rally our people for positive development within the context of a united, egalitarian and democratic Nigeria.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the controversy generated by the law, Hon. Seriake Dickson at an interactive session with newsmen at the Government House Tuesday night said though the intention of the state was misconstrued by some politicians, such fear of secession is misplaced and the law be viewed from the need for the state to create a new identity for itself in the interest of tourism.</p>
<p>Dickson said, “This is just a question of federalism and national identity. If you go to Lagos State, the crest behind the Governor is the crest of Lagos not the Federal Republic. Unfortunately, this is the Nigeria of today. People sensationalize.</p>
<p>“Other states have done it long ago. Now, I want to do it and they are screaming. We want to promote tourism and if visitors come in, we will present them with a plaque and it denotes our identity. I know people will understand and you know that I am a politician of conviction and not convenience.”</p>
<p>Also the President of Conference of Ethnic Nationalities of Niger Delta (CENND) Prof Kimse Okoko defended the Bayelsa State government action which he described as legitimate in a federal setting.</p>
<p>The immediate past President of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) who lampooned the quasi federalism being practiced in the country queried, “What is wrong with the action? The state has the right to its own anthem and flag. It is long overdue and I support what the state government has done.”</p>
<p>The state Commissioner for Culture and Ijaw National Affairs, Felix Tuodolo in his reaction said the Bayelsa State flag, coat of arms and anthem was in tandem with the vision of the founding fathers of the state and the administration’s stand on Ijaw mobilization and integration.</p>
<p>“This decision also underscores government’s belief that this state, like any other state is where the Ijaws, the fourth largest ethnic nationality, has as its home. Bayelsa is home to all Ijaws both at home and abroad. The emblem therefore, will help serve as a unifying force and rallying point for all our people. It says a lot about the preservation of our culture, our essential values as a people and as a race,” he said.</p>
<p>The symbol he further explained was not in any way aimed at undermining the country’s unity. He declared, “the point must be made clear that the steps taken by our government to announce the proposed launch of a state owned flag, anthem and coat of arms is not in any way different from what other states in the federation have done.</p>
<p>“It is common knowledge that virtually all the states in the South Western region such as Lagos, Oyo, Osun, Ondo, Ogun and Ekiti have since launched theirs. The most recent was the North Central state of Kwara. In the South South, Cross River and Rivers States are the only two states in the region that have embraced this noble concept. In the case of Rivers, it was done since the 1970s.</p>
<p>“We believe that Bayelsa State, being the only state that can be considered as the home state of the Ijaw race, deserves even much more to blaze this trail than any other state in the federation, given its uniqueness. This much is true because of the emphasis we place on the propagation of the Ijaw ideals and what we stand for as a people, the Ijaw ideology. More importantly, as a government,we view the decision as critical to our development and it matches our drive to project Bayelsa State as a world class tourist destination, the frontier for eco tourism and an investment haven.”</p>
<p>For Alagoa Morris, a renowned environmental/human rights activist, “it is gratifying to note that this whole issue of anthem and coat of arm is in connection to a state and not individuals; a state in which the governor is not only a lawyer by profession but a former lawmaker of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and former policeman.</p>
<p>“We have been calling for true federalism for too long a time now and, if in a secular federating state like Nigeria we have some states having Sharia as official religion and we recently heard of Islamic banking system, what is the confusion or hullabaloo about Bayelsa coming up with its own anthem and coat? Or are we treating some sections of this country as first class citizens and others second and third class folks?</p>
<p>“As a federating unit, I see practically nothing wrong with a people having something tangible as a unifying factor just as the Ijaws have Haaaaaaaaaan Izon, Aaaaaan Izon. Why hasn’t the government questioned the Ijaws about Aaaaaan Izon? Besides, the fact that we also have the Isoko people as part of Bayelsa State, Izons or Ijaws should have a more unifying structure that will galvanize the people to greater heights. I am also not concerned about what others may say on the issue because people are free to differ in views. Again, like the recent declaration by Ogoni, all human beings are free to chose for themselves; even self determination.”</p>
<p>Another Bayelsan, John Idumange described as uncalled for the hallabaloo over Bayelsa’s adoption of her own coat of arm, flag and anthem citing the practice in the United States of America which is also a federal state.</p>
<p>“It only demonstrates that Bayelsa has come of age as a state within Nigerian federation”.</p>
<p>Under a federal system of government, component states are allowed to have their own flag, coat of arm and anthem except printing their own currency or own armed forces. In the United States of America which is riveting model of federalism, all states; California, Texas, New Jersey, Michigan, New Mexico, Florida among others have their flags flown along with the American national flag,” he said.</p>
<p>Saturday Vanguard investigation however revealed that the Bayelsa State Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem Bill 2012 stipulates fine for any person or group of persons who flies or exhibits the state flag or coat of arms with addition or alterations or adds to, deface and or willfully destroys the state coat of arms and or flag; or adds to or alters the wordings of the state anthem shall be guilty of an offence under this law and shall upon conviction be sentenced to 6 months imprisonment with an option of N100,000.00 fine or both.</p>
<p>The offences under this law the bill added shall be triable by a Chief Magistrate in the state.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Egufe Yafugborhi, PH<br />
LINGERING tussle over who becomes next Vice Chancellor (VC) of the Rivers State University of Science and Technology (RSUST), Port Harcourt assumed violent dimension yesterday with Dr. Felix Igwe, branch Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) reportedly brutalised.</p>
<p>The ASUU leader who has been leading the union on a collision with the varsity’s management is said to be receiving medical attention at an undisclosed hospital after he was battered by assailants suspected to be security operatives at a congress of the union on the university campus.</p>
<p>The assault on Dr. Igwe comes four days into the ongoing strike by members of the union in resentment of the appointment of immediate past VC of the university, Prof. Barikeme Fakae as Acting VC. Condemning the attack, human rights lawyer, Mr. Ken Atsuete, has called for investigation into the circumstances surrounding the assault on the university don.</p>
<p>Mr. Atsueke who described the assault on the ASUU leader as “dastardly and barbaric” assumed that the masterminds of the act may not be “far away from the university authorities.”</p>
<p>Calling on major parties in the leadership crisis rocking the university to shun violence in advancing their interests, Mr. Atsuete concluded that resorting to “violence means that somebody is fighting because he or she is not qualified to be in a certain position he is occupying right now.”</p>
<p>The strike by the branch ASUU demanding Governor Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers to nullify his appointment of Prof. Fakae as Acting VC has paralysed academic activities in the university since Monday.</p>
<p>It would be recalled that the university Public Relations Officer, Mr. Desmond Nwosu had earlier discredited the strike as amounting to dereliction of duty by the lecturers on ground that the school authorities were not pre-informed, a position Dr. Igwe refuted.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Tension yesterday gripped the riverside settlement of Igbomotoru in Southern Ijaw local government area of Bayelsa State following the alleged collision of  Joint military task force gunboat with a passenger boat leading to the death of a community chief.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Samuel Oyadongha, Yenagoa<br />
Tension yesterday gripped the riverside settlement of Igbomotoru in Southern Ijaw local government area of Bayelsa State following the alleged collision of  Joint military task force gunboat with a passenger boat leading to the death of a community chief.</p>
<p>Five others reportedly sustained serious injuries.</p>
<p>As at press time, it was gathered that the traumatized natives were still combing the bed of the river in search of the corpse of the missing man identified as Chief Patrick Eriye.</p>
<p>The names of those injured were given as Solomon Eriye, Lyon Kuwa, Godknows Eriye, Timipa Ikebiri and Esquire Godgift.</p>
<p>Saturday Vanguard gathered that the incident occurred at about 9pm Thursday when the passenger boat rammed into the JTF gunboat patrolling the area.</p>
<p>A Youth Leader in the community, Comrade Ibegi Alakurogha, told Saturday Vanguard  that the men of the patrol team of the JTF were responsible for the incident and the death of the chief.</p>
<p>According to him, the passenger boat was heading to Ikibiri community and loaded with about six persons including a sick indigene of Igbomotoro and was allegedly harrassed and pursued by the men of the JTF.</p>
<p>”The sad news came to the community that a traditional Head and Chief in our community is missing in the river due to the undue harassment and intimidation by the men of the JTF.</p>
<p>“We were told that two passport boats and a gun boat was stationed along the waterways and had stopped and asked them where the passenger boat was heading. And the people told them. On their way back at about 9pm,they were chased by the men of the JTF and out of fear they ran and the accident occurred. Our Chief is missing and we hope he is not dead.</p>
<p>But the Joint Task Force through the Media Co-ordinator, Lt.Col. Onyeama Nwachukwu denied the claims of complicity against the patrol team and said the youths were not vigilante on their trip and rammed into the gun boat.</p>
<p>He said, ”the men of the JTF even assisted in the rescue of six of the passengers of the boat.”</p>

Bayelsa State government yesterday said the home of the Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson is among the 4,350 houses earmarked for demolition in some parts of the state due to the ongoing massive road construction proposed for the state.</p>
<p>The government also presented a cheque to road contractors, Julius Berger and others for the various road projects being executed in various parts of the state.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Monthly Transparency Briefing of the State Government, the State Commissioner for Works  and Infrastructure, Mr. Lawrence Erudjakpor said though the numbers of houses earmarked for demolition have not been concluded and compensation paid, the issue of demolition is part of the sacrifice expected from Bayelsans for the total infrastructural development of the state.</p>
<p>Erudjakpor said the home of the state governor at the Akenfa suburb of the state along the Mbiama-Yenagoa road has not been finally declared for demolition but the final analysis indicated that it may be affected.</p>
<p>According to him, over 4,000 houses would be demolished in the state capital, while over 350 houses would be demolished in the home town of the state governor.</p>
<p>”A total of 4,000 houses have been earmarked for demolition and a total sum of N515.4million to be paid as compensation. In some areas,the state government will not pay compensation based on the fact that the sites are on the right of way of the state government. The governor’s house in Akenfa is also been looked at and if it is concluded that it crossed the right of way of the state, it will be demolished. At Toru Orua community, we have earmarked over 350 houses for demolition and over N134million to be paid as compensation,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in his presentation of the July account of the state, the state Deputy Governor, Rear Admiral John Jonah, said though there were deductions from the state accounts and loans being paid by the state,the amount avalaible to the state as savings is about N20billion.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By JOSEPH ARUNKE, Abuja</p>
<p>The Nigeria Labour Congress said it has concluded arrangements to call workers in the country out on industrial action as solidarity with workers of the Power holding Company of Nigeria, PHCN, who it said, were being unfairly treated by Ministry of Power over their stand that the right things be done before the planned privatisation of the PHCN by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>It said it had set up strike mobilisation committees across the country preparatory to the planned strike which it said, would commence immediately if there was deadlock in their meeting with the government on Wednesday, next week.</p>
<p>The NLC which addressed the press Friday, in Abuja, through its Acting President, Promise Adewumi and Acting General Secretary, Chris Uyot respectively, on the impasse in negotiation between the workers of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria, and the Federal Government, accused the former of being insincere in settling the dispute.</p>
<p>The union said the Federal government reneged on its demand that soldiers should be called off from the PHCN facilities as well as immediate payment of July salary to all PHCN workers for genuine negotiation to commence, saying it was not ready to accept any excuse from the government if the next meeting billed for Wednesday does not address its demands immediately.</p>
<p>The labour also urged the Federal Government to create the enabling environment for a meaningful dialogue just as it asked the government to call the Minister of Power, Professor Barth Nnaji to order, saying the minister has resorted to negative utterances against the workers.</p>
<p>‘’We call on the Federal Government to do the needful by creating the enabling environment for a meaningful dialogue to resolving the issues by calling the Minister of Power to order, withdrawing soldiers from PHCN offices nationwide, and setting up a high powered committee to sincerely address the legitimate concerns of the PHCN workers”, it said</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Simon Ebegbulem, Benin City<br />
G</em><em>en.Don Idada Ikponmwen (Rtd) is the former Provost Marshal of the Nigeria Army. He was the lead prosecutor in the trial of the three Admirals over the Missing MT African Pride, the vessel that disappeared from Navy custody after stealing crude oil worth over N8.3billion in 2003. General Ikponmwen is also an alumnus of both the National Defence College and the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS). </em></p>
<p><em>He is on this account a thorough bread expert in Defense, Law Enforcement and Security. In this interview with Saturday Vanguard, he faulted the decision of the then President Olusegun Obasanjo to cede Bakassi Peninsular to Cameroun. </em></p>
<p><em>With the prevailing call for secession by some groups, the Army general warned that the nation may be heading towards disintegration, citing what he described as the alleged failure by government to guarantee security and good governance to the people. He spoke on several national issues and the recent Edo state governorship election.</em></p>
<p><em>Excerpts:</em></p>
<p><strong>A lot of Nigerians thought the removal of Gen.Andrew Azazi will end the Boko Haram insurgence, what do you think is still the problem Sir?</strong></p>
<p>I know a lot of people believed that the removal of Azazi will change the security situation in the country but that cannot be so because like I have often said, the security problem in Nigeria is not just the question of who is where, it is substantially institutional.</p>
<p>The security organs and establishments must be seriously x-rayed with a view to making adjustments on the laws that set them up, which laws inevitably created duplications and replication of duties. All security agencies, SSS, EFCC, ICPC, they all operate as police establishments.</p>
<div id="attachment_206348" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/10/it%e2%80%99s-sad-govt-can%e2%80%99t-guarantee-security-ikponmwen/ikponmwen/" rel="attachment wp-att-206348"><img class="size-full wp-image-206348 " title="Ikponmwen" src="http://vml1.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ikponmwen.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="" width="300" height="227" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gen. Ikponmwen</p></div>
<p>Each one having power to investigate, each one having power to arrest, each one having power to execute. That is a gamut of confusion. Like the confusion between the police and the SSS when they paraded the alleged killers of Oshiomhole’s Principal Secretary Olaitan.</p>
<p>The police said they arrested four persons who are being interrogated in Benin but the SSS paraded six persons in Abuja on the same matter. That is embarrassing for us as a nation. It shows there is no coordination in intelligence gathering in this country and that is sad. And in this kind of situation, there is definite role. Not only that I have consistently posited that an intelligent organization, starts from the NSA, Immigration, the SSS and others. In terms of intelligence, information gathering, analysis and dissemination, I can say without any fear of contradiction that these organs have not been streamlined in a way to ensure efficient gathering of information and efficient processing of these information.</p>
<p>Nor can we say that the highest organ in the security establishment which is the office of the NSA, has real authority or superintendence over the other security agencies. We cannot say that the office of the NSA is the head of security organizations, like his name says, he is just an Adviser.</p>
<p>He has no executive power. The fact that he attends the National Council of State meeting does not make him an executive. I have continued to say that there is need to review the intelligence sector. The intelligence management in this country must be properly reviewed, given a firm but workable mandate so that we can say yes there is an office for intelligence like the Homeland office in the US. We just must re-organize in order to  we just must protect some organizations from undue exposure and publicity.</p>
<p>A situation where you have the SSS being exposed as the police does not augur well for any country’s intelligence gathering. Why should we unduly expose SSS officials. They are supposed to work under ground, and not be seen. Every body is busy investigating, every body is busy prosecuting. For God’s sake let us be serious as a nation.  So when there is no efficient coordination of intelligence, all we get is confusion galore and the end of it is inefficiency galore. The nation suffers, the killing continues and tension brews every day.</p>
<p><strong>State of emergency </strong></p>
<p>I said it before that merely declaring a state of emergency in some Local Government Areas in four or five states of the Federation will have no effect. It did not really touch the issue and we have since seen that rather than abate the security situation, the Boko Haram trend has continued to worsen. So, it is not declaring of a state of emergency or the removal of one or two individuals that will enhance security.</p>
<p>We need a holistic systemic change. We need a system that will be able to ruthlessly deal with those who failed us in government, if you do not take up squarely people who fail you cannot pave way for efficiency and thoroughness. And in today’s world, it is no longer matter of rhetoric’s, it is time for action, action that will generate the confidence of the people. We need action on a day to day basis to show that this country have a government that wants to move from the present position to a position of seriousness, where not only in Nigeria but the world at large will take us seriously.</p>
<p><strong>But there is this insinuation by Chief EK Clark that some Northern leaders are behind the Boko Haram insurgency which means our security problem is politically motivated?</strong></p>
<p>That is a different matter. There is no doubt that there is a lot of power tussle in this country. There is no doubt that individuals and groups exist that are unduly constituted with acquisition of power just for the sake of the power, even when they do not have any plans on how to use that power to the benefit of the people.</p>
<p>There are some people who on the basis of unjustifiable love for power wants to remain in control for ever. But there are also some people in this country who know that power must not be the exclusive preserve of only a group and that is why we talk about rotation of power, devolution of power and zoning.</p>
<p>These are theories to check the undue love for power. But at the same time, power must be seen to go to those who have the capacity to use it. Who have the motivation, who have the charisma, those who have the vision and the courage to use it.</p>
<p>I do not need to go into specifics but I know that the problem of sharing power in this country has always been a very sore issue and it has continued to be so up till now. Some people think that the Boko Haram is straight away as a result of power not being allowed to go to the North.</p>
<p>But I think that, much as I agree that certain expressions were made by some people from the North that they will make the country ungovernable if the power does not come to the North, for me I will suggest that people should guide what they say because if things turn out to be unwholesome, people are bound to link that statement with what is happening. But I think the problem with Nigeria today is more than this one said this, or that one said that.</p>
<p>There is a question of justice, there is a question of equitable sharing, there is a question of power devolution, there is a question of democracy not working the way it should.</p>
<p>There is a question of individuals who feels that it must be them all the time. There is also a question that even if the power is shared or zoned to you, do you have the right motivation to exercise that power. Nigeria is faced with a lot of problems today.</p>
<p>Thank God that the level of awareness is increasing and we can say that Edo state leads in this crusade. The last governorship election shows that the people are becoming increasingly aware. And I think that if this trend is followed in other parts of the country, soon it will be a matter of the past that a few individuals use money, use blackmail, use deceit to garner power only to abuse it or misuse it to the detriment of the people. I think Nigeria is at cross road, there is no question about it.</p>
<p>The only thing that can save this country is efficiency, thoroughness and commitment to what is good for the people and good governance. Without good governance, without efficient government, without a government at all levels that works for the benefit of the people, it will be mere wishful thinking to think that Nigeria will even stay together as one.</p>
<p><strong>What is your take about the confusion in Bakassi and the rising determination of some parts of the country such as the Ogoni’s to declare their own state?</strong></p>
<p>The Bakassi situation to me is quite worrisome. I have no intension to review the history of Bakassi, tracing it from the secession of that part of the country to Germans by Britain as far back as 1930. Or how former Adamawa now came to become part of Nigeria and how the other part now went to the Cameroons after we achieved Independence and all the politics that inter played.</p>
<p>However, I can only tell you that the way that Bakassi was hurriedly ceded to Cameroun vie the green tree agreement that was signed by former President Obasanjo and former President of Cameroun Paul Biya was so terrible  that it rubbished the status of man as member of a society and of a people who form part of the society.</p>
<p>Without any form of referendum they found out that they have been ceded to Cameroun. It is true that the International Court of Justice gave a ruling which was merely declaratory that the sovereignty over Bakassi resided in the Cameroons.</p>
<p>But there have been so many declaratory judgments all over the world. Palestinian and Israeli matter has been on. Eretria and Ethiopia land dispute which has been on for a long time despite the ICJ judgment. We all have respect for the ICJ but we must also consider the plight of our people who resides in that area and that ought to have given rise to the proper thing being done over the Bakassi issue such that the Bakassi people will feel that they have a government to whom their plight was considered important.</p>
<p>I have no reservation in condemning the hurry over which Bakassi was handed over to Cameroun, I think it should not have happened like that. We should not turn our individual ego of any ruler at a time he was in power, to be the yardstick in deciding the fate of the people.</p>
<p>The lingering dispute over the sovereignty of the Falklands, the persisting stalemate over the sovereignty of the lands occupied by Israel, the continuing dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia and even the stalemate over the retention of and treatment of the prisoners of war in the Guatamano camp in Cuba, despite the advisory opinion of the ICJ in each case, are lucid illustrations not only that nations are never in undue hurry to implement ICJ rulings without subjecting same to local imperatives but also that the interest of the subjects (the concern persons) are paramount in deciding what nations do.</p>
<p>It is my view therefore that the hurry in reaching the Green Tree Agreement to handover Bakassi Penisula to the Cameroons two years after the ICJ declaratory ruling, without recourse to the people of Bakassi in referendum was a manifest negation of the right of the people of Bakassi to self determination. It is only in Nigeria that this kind of thing could have happened.</p>
<p>Having said that, when you look at the Bakassi issue, the Ogoni issue, the OPC, the MASSOB, Egbesu, it all centers on the feeling of injustice, feeling of cheating, feeling of oppression. All these are not signs of an efficient system. We must come to grip with what is evolving around the whole world. What happened in the former Soviet Union? What happened in the Balkans? What happened in the Czech and Slovak?</p>
<p>These nations disintegrated. If the center cannot keep every body together then the doctrine of right to self determination is bound to creep in. The Doctrine of self determination has become a world doctrine. The world is no more governed by rhetorics.  What people want is a government that will make them comfortable, happy, secured and put food on their table.</p>
<p>This is what a government is all about. So when you have a situation where large number of people in a society feels that their interest are not taken into consideration, you cannot rule out the issue of, call it inordinate demands or are they really inordinate? Will it not be a better approach to ensure there is efficiency? Will it not be a better approach to ensure that leaders are properly chosen and emerge on the platform of the people who has the power to choose their rulers. Will it not be better to ensure that we give better meaning to the issue of sovereignty belonging to the people as every body knows.</p>
<p>A situation where people are running for election, they can crawl to any home to beg for votes but the moment they are elected, they become inaccessible. I think we need to re-examine ourselves in this country. The moment we have a government that is accountable to the people, the moment the people demand their right consistently, the moment there is justice, the moment you know where to go and your problem is solved, the moment a government considers security as the primary purpose of government, then we will be able to say with all assurances that inordinate ambitions, unjustifiable demands will go.</p>
<p><strong>But are you satisfied with the efforts being made by President Goodluck Jonathan to fix these problems?</strong></p>
<p>I have never doubted the good intension of President Jonathan, he is a humble man, it is evident in him that he means well. Whether he has been able to put the structures that will achieve the desired goods, that will invoke the confidence of people, that will remove the fears of both the minorities and the majorities, is quite a different thing. Quite unfortunately, things don’t seem to improve  since his assumption of office.</p>
<p>Then, I think the best thing is for everybody to put his hands on deck to find solution, advise, corporate with government so that we can move forward. Some people are also worried that there is conspiracy among Federal legislators to unseat the President. I don’t think that unseating the President should be the focus of any legislator.</p>
<p>But at the same time, as a lawyer, I know that the Presidential system of government strives on checks and balances. When there is undue, unwarranted and over emphasized corporation between the arms of government that is a negation of the Presidential system. Because the hallmark of Presidential system is the fact that one arm of government act as a check on the other. The legislature must check the excesses of the executive.</p>
<p>The Executive must get the approval of the legislator as regards spending, you cannot declare a war with the approval of the National Assembly. Because in this country, the constitution is supreme, the parliament is not supreme. Supremacy resides on the people.</p>
<p>The constitution, no matter the lapses for now remains the yardstick for which any action of government is judged. So checks and balances must be allowed. President is traveling and he is accompanied by legislators, governor is traveling and he is accompanied by Judges, those are a negation of our presidential system. That is not to say we cannot have a unity of purpose in terms of good objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Edo</strong> <strong>state governorship election</strong></p>
<p>Like I have always said, I am glad that Edo state has become a beckon in charting a way forward for credible elections. By and large the election was proved to be credible. We must give kudos to INEC, we must give kudos to President Jonathan, we must give kudos to the people whose awareness is growing every day.</p>
<p>We must give kudos to the media who monitored the process. We must give kudos to the civil societies who kept calling on the need for free and fair election. We are glad despite initial hitches which some people experienced on the day of election when materials from INEC were not getting to the polling booths in time .</p>
<p>Despite all these, the election went well, no ballot snatching, no killing, no fighting and the result which was overwhelmingly in favour of Oshiomhole has been largely accepted by the people even though there are discordant tones from our party, the PDP, the candidate wanting to challenge the result but the party said there is no need for that. I think we should be happy that Edo state has charted a course, a direction that now constitutes a sign post for the rest of the nation.</p>
