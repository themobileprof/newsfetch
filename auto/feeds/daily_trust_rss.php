			<title>Senate opposes introduction of N5,000 note</title>

			<description><![CDATA[The Senate has directed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to suspend its plan to introduce N5,000 note, describing it as a policy somersault.<br /><br />Addressing journalists in Abuja today, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Currency and other Financial Institutions, Senator Bassey Otu (PDP, Cross River South) slammed the CBN Governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, for not informing the National Assembly before rolling out the plan, saying the Senate would soon formally send a memo to the CBN to stop all further actions on the matter until the Senate is properly briefed.  <br /><br />According to him, moving against the proposed new currency note does not imply that the Senate is against the independence of the apex bank, but rather, the upper chamber is concerned about how adversely the new currency will affect Nigerians.<br /><br />The Senator, who said such a policy is usually introduced where there is a major financial crisis, warned the CBN against sending a signal that the nation's currency is valueless.<br /><br />"The CBN, in 2008 and 2009, came up with a proposal to re-denominate the currency that was even to take off the zeros. This was just 2008 and 2009 and here we are in 2012, the CBN is seeing a kind of policy somersault. I believe that we have to be well briefed on this. Also in 2005, the CBN undertook a major currency restructuring which ran into billions of naira. Till date, a proper value has not been done to know its costs to the Nigerian taxpayers and the extent of the benefits and in that 2005 coinage. I think it did not work at all because both the goldsmiths and the blacksmiths converted the coins to molding bangles, earrings and so on etc."]]></description>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sergeant Adamu who was attached to Gwale Police Division in the state, had last week allegedly shot dead Hassan Muhammad at Gwale quarters. The killing of the boy, who was hawking sachet water, sparked protest in the area, with angry youths threatening to raze the nearby Gwale Police Decision.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The police spokesperson said the Kano State police commissioner, Ibrahim K Idris, gave the go ahead for the dismissed cop to be prosecuted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“After undergoing orderly room trial, he was found culpable of the offence and dismissed,” said the police spokesperson.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It would be recalled that the victim’s father, Malam Muhammadu Muhalli, had vowed to fight for justice over his son’s killing.</p>

			<title>Convoy accidents: FRSC ‘shame register’ dormant</title>
			<link>http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php/news/175304-convoy-accidents-frsc-shame-register-dormant</link>
			<guid>http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php/news/175304-convoy-accidents-frsc-shame-register-dormant</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[The ‘shame register’ introduced by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in December 2011 is seemingly ineffective following increase in convoy accidents resulting from dangerous driving.
<p style="text-align: justify;" />

The register was introduced by the Corps to shame highly placed individuals whose convoys drive recklessly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Corps Marshal of the FRSC Osita Chidoka said the details of vehicles of top government personnel found guilty of violating traffic regulations written in the Corps ‘shame register’ will be made public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“But eight months after the declaration, the Corps hasn’t shamed any convoy driver in spite of their flagrant abuse of traffic regulations,” one FRSC personnel said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another source said, “convoy drivers were not ‘shamed’ because none was found guilty of any offence” and that the ‘shame’ register “was mostly functional during festivities.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Convoy drivers particularly the governors’ drivers have blamed their superiors of forcing them to over speed and disregard traffic regulations, FRSC report on convoy drivers training recently said. The Corps had conducted refresher training for convoy drivers last year during which a number of governors’ driver who attended said their principals mostly instruct them to drive faster. The report said the drivers whose health conditions are mostly unsound following poor remuneration and inadequate medical tests confessed that their superiors would often instruct them to move at high speed to catch appointments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Daily Trust contacted the FRSCs Road Transport Safety Standardization Scheme office in Abuja which also organizes convoy drivers’ training for details about its previous reports, the officials said the report hasn’t been made available to the public and apart from convoy drivers; they also conducted trainings for tanker and commercial bus drivers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Head of the Scheme, Kayode Olagunju, said he was not authorized to make the outcome of the trainings public. However Premium Times news agency quoted the report was sent to the Rivers State Governor Rotimi Amechi. “Some of the drivers claimed they were usually forced to drive above the stipulated speed limits to catch up appointments and that safety was not always the major concern of their principals,” the FRSC said in its report, a copy which was sent to the governor who heads the Governors’ Forum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between 2008 to date, 12 state governors’ convoys were involved in accidents including one involving Katsina State government vehicles, many of them fatal, with 2012 alone recording three, as of June. A road crash involving five vehicles belonging to Jigawa State government occurred last week near Kano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crashes have killed 17 people and left many injured. And in nearly all of the cases, witnesses blamed the convoys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FRSC said it found that dozens of the drivers, many who are poorly remunerated, to have abnormal eyesight and dangerously high blood pressure, with nearly 300 drivers having got their jobs either without a driver’s licenses or with expired permits. One driver from Yobe State, apparently the worst case, had his last license renewal in1998.</p>]]></description>

			<title>N5000 note rubbishes ‘cashless’ policy - ACN</title>
			<link>http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php/news/175305-n5000-note-rubbishes-cashless-policy-acn</link>
			<guid>http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php/news/175305-n5000-note-rubbishes-cashless-policy-acn</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[The Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) has asked the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to rethink its plan to introduce N5000 denomination into the nation’s currency system as it could harm the economy.
<p style="text-align: justify;" />

The party said the unintended consequences and collateral damage of introducing the N5000 note and other restructuring of the nation’s currencies in 2013 may far outweigh the benefits of the new measure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a statement yesterday, ACN national publicity secretary, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said while the introduction of new note may serve the dual purpose of raising revenue for government on one hand and reducing the cost of transactions on the other hand, it among others often signifies a regime of increased and sustained fiscal deficit financing of an economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Secondly the issuance of such high value currency notes is likely to be perceived as an indication of government’s failure to effectively control inflation. Unfortunately once this perception takes hold, increased inflation expectations can be built up quite rapidly and these have pushed many countries into a situation of hyper-inflation in the past, which has typically culminated in the redenomination or even complete abandonment of the entire currency system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Thirdly the issuance of the N5, 000 currency notes runs counter to the recent policy of the CBN to promote a “cashless” economy by encouraging the increased use of non-cash transaction instruments. This policy which is aimed at reducing the use of cash had been justified by the need to reduce the burden of the cost of printing and distributing currency notes. The introduction of a high face value currency note actually does the opposite because by reducing the unit cost of printing and transportation, it actually would promote the use of cash,” Mohammed said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While saying that there is a close relationship between inflation and issuance of high value currency notes, he listed some countries across the world to buttress his claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “Between 1975 and 1991, Argentina experienced a period of inflation during which increasingly higher face value notes were issued. At the beginning of 1975, the highest denomination in Argentina was 1,000 pesos. This rose to 5,000 pesos in late 1976, then to 10,000 pesos in 1979 and rose further to 1,000,000 in 1981. As this trend became clearly unsustainable, a series of currency reforms followed. This did not curb the inflation.”</p>]]></description>
