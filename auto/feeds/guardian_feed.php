			<title>Wike Promises Government’s  Counterpart Funding In 2013 Budget </title>

			<description><![CDATA[<div>
<p>THE Minister of State for Education, Ezenwo Wike, has re-iterated the determination of the current administration to effectively implement all bilateral agreements entered into with foreign partners towards delivery quality education in the country. As a demonstration of that determination, he said the government has planned to incorporate its counterpart funding into national budgets come next year to avoid lapses.</p>
<p>The minister, who made the remark while playing host to the newly appointed Country Representative of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Mr. Tetsuo Seki, in his office in Abuja, however, called on the agency to expand its area of collaboration with the Nigerian government, especially in its ongoing Strengthening Mathematics and Science Education (SMASE) programme.</p>
<p>Under the programme, while the Japanese government is providing technical assistance in the training of science and Mathematics teachers in some selected states of the federation, participating state governments are expected to provide logistics. The programme is being co-ordinated by the National Teachers’ Institute (NTI), Kaduna.</p>
<p>Wike’s renewed commitment was prompted by Seki’s revelation that some of the participating state governments under the first phase of the programme were not showing enough commitments, especially giving their failure to release their counterpart funding for effective execution.</p>
<p>Seki, however, commended effective leadership style being provided by Wike towards redressing the situation.</p>
<p>Wike said the government was willing to partner with international partners towards improving quality of education concerning particularly Mathematics and other science subjects in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The minister, who admitted low commitments in terms of budgetary provision, however, said the government had decided to redress the problem by capturing all its financial commitments as regards counterpart funding to avoid undue delay, saying the process would begin with the 2013 budget.</p>
<p>Wike said: “You can be rest assured that whatever it is to be done SMASE programme will be highly upgraded and we will do all we can to give it the necessary support. The last time we held stakeholders’ meeting, we identified some problems. One of those problems had to do with budgetary constraints. But I am happy to tell to you that in future all our contributions, in terms of finance, will be built into our national budget so that we would not have any course to delay.</p>
<p>“For 2013 budget, which we are already preparing, we are building our own counterpart funding into the process, so that we do not encounter setbacks as far as this programme is concerned. It is a programme that means much for this government.&nbsp; If you looked at the performance of candidates in public examinations, mostly it in Mathematics and science-related subjects, you would see that we recorded lot of failures. So, with this intervention, we think we are coming closer to resolving all the problems of this low performance in public examination.”</p>

			<title>DFID Floats Project Towards Amicable Disputes Resolution In Enugu </title>
			<link>http://ngrguardiannews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=95915:dfid-floats-project-towards-amicable-disputes-resolution-in-enugu-&amp;catid=1:national&amp;Itemid=559</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<div>
<p>THE Department for International Development (DFID) has launched a project aimed at finding amicable resolution to disputes among communities in Enugu State.</p>
<p>The project, an off shoot of the DFID’s Justice for All Programme (J4A), tends to enlighten women on the need to be involved in the settlement of disputes in their communities.</p>
<p>DFID said the project would help to decongest courts of communal cases as well as speed up resolutions in the process.</p>
<p>Enugu State Coordinator for J4A, Mrs. Josephine Onah, who disclosed this in a sensitisation programme at Ochima, Igbo&nbsp;Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State, stated&nbsp;that the programme would encourage women to settle disputes that men may occasionally find difficult to handle in communities.</p>
<p>She said that four pilot communities in Enugu State, including Ndeabor&nbsp;of Aninri Local Government Area; Ochima of Igbo-Etiti; Aro-Agu of Igbo Eze South and Abor of Udi Local Government Area, have been selected, addinging that the desire of the DFID on the J4A programme was to reduce to the barest minimum several litigations in court.<br /> Onah told the women that they are recognised as custodians of culture as well as mediators and<br /> advisers on issues affecting girls and women in communities where they exist or function, hence, the need to find better and amicable way of settling disputes without recourse to<br /> court actions.<br /> “In recognition of your vital role in the society,&nbsp;J4A deemed it worthy to support this programme that will raise awareness and enhance knowledge and understanding&nbsp;of Umuadas (daughters) so that they will have greater knowledge on how&nbsp;to carry out functions in a manner that is fair, equitable that will be in line with tradition of the Igbo culture and&nbsp;modern human rights tenets.&nbsp;To actualise this, the J4A is working through a civil society organisation, Women Action Research Organisation (WARO), to raise awareness and create understanding in four communities in Enugu State,” she said.</p>

<p>KWARA State Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources Mr. Bode Olayemi has described FADAMA programme as a calculated attempt by the government to reduce poverty among its teeming masses.</p>
<p>Olayemi who described Kwara as an agrarian state, yesterday in Ilorin at the flag off event of fifth phase of agricultural inputs distribution to the FADAMA beneficiary farmers in the state, said Kwara State government would continually render technical support especially the distribution of farm tools aimed at making the state a food basket of the nation.</p>
<p>According to him, “the objective of FADAMA project which is to sustainably increase the incomes of the users of land and water resources. By increasing beneficiaries’ incomes, the project will help reduce poverty, ensure food security and contribute to the achievement of a key Millennium Development Goal (MDG).</p>
<p>“This objective is no doubt encapsulated in the broad policy framework of the government, which is to develop and expand agricultural potentials of the state to ensure food security, provide raw materials for industries and produce for both domestic consumption and export.”</p>
<p>Promising more of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in the agricultural sector in the state, the Commissioner said the development would help in employment drive and prompt transformation of the rural areas to urban centres via provisions of needed social infrastructure. He lauded the beneficiaries of the government gestures for coming together under various&nbsp;cooperative groups, thereby making it easier for the government to enter into veritable collaborations with them especially in the areas of marketing of their produce like rice and fish.</p>
<p>Some production inputs like fertiliser and spraying pumps were later distributed to the farmers at subsidised prices.</p>
<p>The state Project Coordinator, Usman Akanbi listed some of the inherent benefits that accrued&nbsp;to the beneficiaries of the African Development Bank (ADB)-assisted development project to include, agro inputs distributed&nbsp;to FADAMA farmers at highly subsidised rate of 50 percent, opening up 30 kilometre road, provisions of&nbsp;veterinary clinics and sinking of deep wells with hand pumps.</p>
<p>Items distributed include 263 sprayers, 40 pepper grinding machines, 30 water pumps, three groundnut extractors, three hammer mills, three yam flour processing machines and 6,600 bags of urea fertiliser among others.</p>

<p>PHARMACISTS under the aegis of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) have decried the poor security arrangement in the country with regards to the protection of lives and properties.</p>
<p>They made the statement while calling on the Federal Government, Governors of the South Eastern States, and security agencies to facilitate the immediate release of the Vice Chancellor of Enugu State University of Technology, Professor Cyprian Onyeji.</p>
<p>Onyeji, a pharmacist and active member of PSN, was abducted on Wednesday, August 15, at the gate of the University as he was being driven to his office.</p>
<p>In a statement by its National President, Azubuike Okwor, PSN said: “The attention of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria has been drawn to the unfortunate kidnap of the Vice Chancellor of Enugu State University of Technology, Professor Cyprian Onyeji, a seasoned Pharmacist and an astute administrator.</p>
<p>“We learnt he was abducted at the gate of the University as he was being driven to his office.</p>
<p>This incident yet again brings to light the poor security apparatus in place with regards to the protection of lives and properties in our country. We are also disturbed at the new wave of attacks where pharmacists have become targets of assassins, kidnappers and gunmen in the South-east part of the country.</p>
<p>“Last month, a lady pharmacist miraculously escaped from the grip of kidnappers in one of the States in the South East. For the records, Professor Cyprian Onyeji is a hard working Vice Chancellor who has brought changes and sustainable reforms to the Enugu State University.</p>
<p>“While we call on the Federal and Enugu State Government to facilitate the immediate release of this eminent Nigerian, we appeal to the Governors of the South East and Security Agencies to do more to stem the worsening cases of kidnapping in the zone.”</p>
